        "\n",
        "In the context of a regression model, R-squared and Adjusted R-squared are metrics used to evaluate how well the independent variables explain the variation in the dependent variable.\n",
        "\n",
        "**R-squared (R²)**\n",
        "\n",
        "*   **Definition**: R-squared is a statistical measure that represents the proportion of the variance for a dependent variable that's explained by the independent variables in a regression model.\n",
        "*   **Interpretation**: It ranges from 0 to 1 (or 0% to 100%). A higher R-squared value indicates that more of the variation in the dependent variable can be explained by the independent variables. For example, an R-squared of 0.407 means that approximately 40.7% of the variation in 'GPA' can be explained by 'SAT' and 'Rand 1,2,3' in this model.\n",
        "*   **Limitation**: R-squared can be misleading when comparing models with different numbers of independent variables. Adding more independent variables, even if they are not significant, will generally increase the R-squared value.\n",

        "*   **Interpretation**: It is generally lower than R-squared. Adjusted R-squared increases only if the new term improves the model more than would be expected by chance. It is a better measure for comparing models with different numbers of independent variables. In this case, the Adjusted R-squared of 0.392 is slightly lower than the R-squared, which is expected when adding independent variables.\n",
        "*   **Usefulness**: Adjusted R-squared is particularly useful when building multiple regression models where you are considering several potential independent variables. It helps in selecting a model that provides the best fit without being overly complex.\n",
        "\n",
        "In summary, while R-squared tells you how much of the variation in the dependent variable is explained by your model, Adjusted R-squared provides a more accurate picture, especially when comparing models with different numbers of predictors, by accounting for the number of independent variables used."

        "\n",
        "Linear regression models make several assumptions about the data to ensure the validity and reliability of the results. It's important to check these assumptions before interpreting the model.\n",
        "\n",
        "Here are the key assumptions:\n",
        "\n",
        "1.  **Linearity**: The relationship between the independent variables and the dependent variable is linear. This means the change in the dependent variable is proportional to the change in the independent variables. You can check this assumption by plotting the dependent variable against each independent variable.\n",
        "2.  **Independence of Errors (No Autocorrelation)**: The errors (residuals) of the model are independent of each other. This means that the error for one observation does not influence the error for another observation. This assumption is particularly important in time series data. The Durbin-Watson statistic in the model summary can help detect autocorrelation.\n",
        "3.  **Homoscedasticity (Constant Variance of Errors)**: The variance of the errors is constant across all levels of the independent variables. In other words, the spread of the residuals is roughly the same throughout the range of the predicted values. You can check this assumption by plotting the residuals against the predicted values. Heteroscedasticity (non-constant variance) can affect the standard errors of the coefficients.\n",
        "4.  **Normality of Errors**: The errors (residuals) of the model are normally distributed. This assumption is important for hypothesis testing and confidence intervals. You can check this assumption by looking at a histogram or a Q-Q plot of the residuals.\n",
        "5.  **No Multicollinearity**: The independent variables are not highly correlated with each other. High multicollinearity can make it difficult to determine the individual effect of each independent variable on the dependent variable and can lead to unstable coefficient estimates. You can check for multicollinearity by examining the correlation matrix of your independent variables or calculating Variance Inflation Factors (VIF).\n",

Positive autocorrelation (where consecutive errors are positively correlated) leads to underestimated standard errors, making the coefficients appear more statistically significant than they actually are (inflated t-statistics and smaller p-values). Negative autocorrelation (where consecutive errors are negatively correlated) leads to overestimated standard errors, making the coefficients appear less significant.\n",

        "2.  **Autocorrelation Function (ACF) and Partial Autocorrelation Function (PACF) Plots**: These plots are commonly used in time series analysis.
